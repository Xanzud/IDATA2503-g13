Design guidelines - Prepactive  
Concept phase  
1. Theme: how serious or playful the design should be  
  Considering this being an app for a humanitarian organization, it will be 100% serious.  
2. Color scheme:  
  -Does the company have a color scheme?  
    oRed (#ff0000) and white (#ffffff)in keeping with the established color profiling of the Red Cross.  
  -Which colors are suggested by the theme of the site?  
    oRed and white.  
  -Main color  
    oWhite.  
  - Accent color (optional)  
    oRed  
3. Hierarchy and layout:  
  -What is the order of importance for the different elements?  
    oUpon sign in, users will be taken to a page showing info on any active mission for their organization.  
    If no active mission is available, there will be a textsaying “No ongoing mission”. All other information will be available from the left hand menu.  
  -What sections will there be?  
    The screen will consists of two sections: the main view, which shows the currently relevant information, i.e. current mission or user profile,  
    and the left side menu, which can be shown by pressing a button on the left side of the screen. Pressing the button again will hide the menu again.  
    Pressing the menu buttons will change the main view to show the new information.  
  -What layout(s) will you use for the sections?  
    The app will have a row widget, containing two items, one for the left side menu, and one for the main view.  
    The left side menu will consists of a list view widget. The main view widget will vary depending on what is currently being shown.I.e.  
    list view for member list/packing list, column widget for personal info etc. The login menu will be made using a scaffold.  
4. Images:  
   -Except for icons for buttons there will not be any images.  
5. Icons:  
  -Will we use icons and for what?  
   Basic built in icons for flutter will be used. (Search, Add, Logout), for basic functionality.  
  -Colored or black-and-white/greyscale icons?  
   Black-and-white.  
6. Typography:  
  -Should it by a Serif or Sans-Serif font?  
   Sans Serif font styles will be used in this project.  
  -Bold or thin font?  
   Depends on which contributes to the best visibility.  
  -Rounded or sharp edges?  
   Sharp edges.  
7. Border rounding:  
  -Small border rounding on buttons. When it comes to other objects, mainly no.  
  -How rounded should be the edges, according to the theme?  
    oWeak but noticeable.  
8. Shadows:  
  -How much shadow will we use in general, according to the theme?  
   Buttons and forms, to make them ‘pop out’. Noticeable but not much.
